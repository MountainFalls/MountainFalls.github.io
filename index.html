                              <p><br><br><br><br>Mountain Falls is an electrical engineer and multimedia artist who is currently pursuing a Masters of Science in Electrical Engineering at the University of St. Thomas in the Power Systems Track. In recognition of Mountain’s specialties in product development and entrepreneurship they received a full ride scholarship and monthly stipend through St. Thomas’ New Product Tech Ventures (NPTV) Program--a fellowship that fully funds a select few masters of engineering students while providing them with product development focused learning opportunities in addition to their graduate coursework. Mountain will graduate with an MS in electrical Engineering in the fall of 2025.
							  <br><br>During their first semester of their masters program Mountain entered into the University of St. Thomas’ Fowler Business Concept Challenge. Their submission was the concept for bidirectional smart charger for electric vehicles(EVs) that would allow the user to lease unused battery capacity to power utilities in exchange for energy credit. This system would reduce the growing burden of EVs on electrical grids saving power utilities millions while reducing charging costs for EV owners. Mountain’s submission moved from semi finals to finals and won second place out of over 100 submissions awarding Mountain with a $7,000 scholarship. 
                              <br><br>Outside of academics, Mountain is pursuing a passion project developing a novel analog synthesizer with the form factor of an electric guitar. As their capstone project in their Bachelors in Applied Electrical Engineering in Music Technology Mountain developed a prototype for this synthesizer and is now working on the second iteration. This synthesizer will feature 6 VCOs, 1 LFO, 6 ADSR envelopes generators, 6 VCFs, a 6 channel mixer, and midi input and output. The synth is the shape of an electric guitar and plays in a similar fashion. There are 6 linear touch sensors on the guitar neck that control pitch and 6 pressure sensors on the body that control note velocity. The working prototype was a three “string” model and was designed as a proof of concept for the system. More information about this project can be found in the Synth section of this website.
							  <br><br>As an artist Mountain is a musician and woodworker who is interested in combining musicianship, woodwork, and music in the creation of the guitar synthesizer. Outside of that project Mountain plays classical guitar and sings in a group called Brother Means Ally. Music updates can be found in the Music page on this website. This group is newly formed and is soon to record their first album. In woodworking Mountain constructs intricate tables from hardwood and uses the offcutting to make hardwood earrings. Woodworking information can be found in the Woodcraft section of this website.
